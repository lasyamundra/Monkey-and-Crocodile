The crocodile, having enjoyed the sweet berries that the monkey shared, goes back to the tree the next day. The monkey happily shares the fruits from the tree. They spend the entire day talking and eating berries. Soon, the monkey and the crocodile became good friends and began to trust each other.

They started spending more time together, spending their afternoons eating the sweet berries and talking about everything under the sky. One day, the generous monkey sent a few fresh berries for the crocodile’s wife.

The crocodile’s wife listened to her husband talk about the monkey and their friendship, as she ate the sweet berries. But she did not like that her husband spent a lot of time with the monkey. She was jealous.

She thought of a wicked plan and said, “The berries are lovely. I’m happy that you shared them with me. Why didn’t you tell about it sooner?” And then she added, “If the berries are so sweet, I wonder how sweet the monkey’s heart would be, given that he eats these berries every day?”

The crocodile was aghast at the thought. His wife, however, was insistent. She said “I want you to bring me the monkey’s heart. Get it to me if you want to make me happy”. The crocodile, shocked at the idea of killing his friend said, “I cannot do that to my friend. He trusts me. I will get you more berries if you like.”

“I don’t want more berries! I just want his heart or nothing. And I won’t eat anything until you bring that to me”, she insisted. Dejected, the crocodile finds himself in a rather difficult situation. Should I kill my friend to please my wife? Or should I save my friend and face the wrath of my wife? Thinking so, he sets out to the river where the monkey lives.
