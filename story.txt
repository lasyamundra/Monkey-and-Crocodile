The crocodile, having enjoyed the sweet berries that the monkey shared, goes back to the tree the next day. The monkey happily shares the fruits from the tree. They spend the entire day talking and eating berries. Soon, the monkey and the crocodile became good friends and began to trust each other.

They started spending more time together, spending their afternoons eating the sweet berries and talking about everything under the sky. One day, the generous monkey sent a few fresh berries for the crocodileâ€™s wife.
